### Object-oriented Programming

In object-oriented programming (OOP), you structure your code based on the concept of objects.

In commonly used OOP languages (such as Java or C#), we create a template for an object using the keyword ~~class~~ and we instantiate an object using the keyword ~~new~~. These objects contain fields that store data and methods that manipulate data. In this style, an object can be passed as an argument in the function of another object.

### Functional Programming

In functional programming, you create a solution by structuring code mainly using functions. Functions are **first-class citizens** in this paradigm, meaning we can use them to store and manipulate data. Similar to objects in object-oriented programming, in functional programming, functions can be passed in as arguments to other functions and can be returned by other functions.
