When we represent data as bars of different heights, sometimes, we need to visually communicate some sort of uncertainty in the heights of those bars.

Here are some examples:

- The average number of students in a 3rd grade classroom is 30, but some classes have as few as 18 and others have as many as 35 students.
- We measured that the weight of a certain fruit was 35g, but we know that our scale isnâ€™t very precise, so the true weight of the fruit might be as much as 40g or as little as 30g.

To display error visually in a bar chart, we often use error bars to show where each bar _could be_, taking errors into account.

```py {numberLines}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib. pyplot as plt
```

```py {numberLines}
subjects = ["Physics", "Chemistry", "Mathematics", "Botany", "Zoology"]

marks = [85, 76, 90, 84, 58]

error = [10, 7, 4, 6, 5]

plt.bar(range(len(subjects)), marks, yerr=error, capsize=6)
```

Each of the black lines is called an _error bar_. The taller the bar is, the more uncertain we are about the height of the blue bar. The horizontal lines at the top and bottom are called _caps_. They make it easier to read the error bars.

To make the caps wide and easy to read, we can increase the cap size.

```py {numberLines}
plt.bar(range(len(subjects)), marks, yerr=error, capsize=15)
```
