A _correlation_ coefficient expresses how strongly two variables are related.

Its possible values range from ~~-1.0~~ to ~~+1.0~~, but in practice you never find correlations so extreme. The closer a correlation coefficient is to ~~+-1.0~~, the stronger the relationship between two variables.

A correlation of ~~0.0~~ means no relationship. So, you might find a correlation of ~~+0.7~~ (fairly strong) between, let's say, advertising budget & the total revenue. The higher the advertising budget, the more that gets sold.
