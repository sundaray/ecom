I had set two goals for myself for the month of November:

- write 20 blog posts
- and learn Next.js

I wrote 48 blog posts in total, but I did not start learning Next.js. Instead, I focused on Tailwind CSS & MongoDB.

I had been hearing great things about Tailwind CSS for quite some time. So I finally decided to give it a go - and it turned out to be awesome. Of course, I have only scratched the surface of all the great features that Tailwind CSS offers. So, my plan is to rewrite some of my existing projects using Tailwind CSS. That will provide me with a good opportunity to explore the internals of the technology.

Besides Tailwind CSS, I focused on MongoDB. Even though I have been using MongoDB as my database of choice for all my projects, I have not really taken the time to deeply understand the technology. Going forward, I aim to dive deep into some of the fundamental concepts and try to understand what really goes on under the hood.

I also wrote a few blog posts on CSS grid. Every time I use CSS grid, I end up spending quite a bit of time searching for the right properties to use. Now that I have the blog posts, I will be saving a lot of time.

My plan for December is to write an ebook on how to create a developer blog using Gatsby. I might sell it on Gumroad or decide to give it as a free download in exchange for an e-mail address. With regards to blogging, I will be happy if I manage to write 20 blog posts as I anticipate some workload on the professional front.

Thatâ€™s it for me.

What are your plans for December? Do let me know in the comments.

Adios, until then.
