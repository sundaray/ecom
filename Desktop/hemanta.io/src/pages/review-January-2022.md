In January, I achieved my target of writing 10 blog posts.

My original plan was to build a developer blog using Gatsby. Even though I started following the tutorial on the official Gatsby site, I veered off course. I practiced a little bit of React and Python on Codecademy. Essentially, my coding practice was all over the place.

On the personal front, things are going well. I have completely settled into my new place at Gurgaon. Also, I have been exercising regularly and paying attention to my diet. So, there has been tremendous improvement in my overall mood and energy.

I want to take my fitness goals a step further. So, I will be joining a gym next week. I have always struggled with discipline especially in matters related to the gym. This time however, I am determined to make it work. If I remain consistent with my diet and training for at least 6 months, I should be able to build muscle mass and improve my overall strength. In the long-term however, I would love to make regular exercise a part of my lifestyle, rather than a short-term goal.

My plan for February is to continue practicing Python on Codecademy and write 5 blog posts related to the topic. I will also migrate the styling of this blog from plain CSS to Tailwind CSS. In addition, if time permits, I will also add a _categories_ section to the home page of this blog, so that readers can navigate and find relevant content more easily.

That's it for me.

What did you do in January? Have you been keeping your new year's resolutions?

Let me know in the comments.

See you folks in February. Adios until then.
