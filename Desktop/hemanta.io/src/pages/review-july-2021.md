###### Read my June'21 review [here](https://hemanta.io/review-june-2021/).

My July targets were conservative - I wanted to write 10 blog posts and complete 20 chapters of the React course by Jad Jourban. Not only did I achieve the targets but also exceed them by a wide margin - I wrote 40 blog posts and completed all the 86 sections of the course.

Besides, I bought and finished the [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/) course by Dan Abramov. I also started reading the [You Don’t Know JS Yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) (Book Series) - 2nd Edition by Kyle Simpson. These two resources helped me develop the right mental model and plug a lot of gaps in my JavaScript knowledge.

Overall, I am pleased with the progress I made in July.

What’s the plan for August?

I am planning to learn Python. I will finish the Python 3 Programming Specialization on Coursera and write 10 blog posts, which are most probably going to be related to Python.

Why Python?

I have decided to shift my focus from web development to data science. I will write a blog post soon explaining why I decided to change track after a year-long immersion in full-stack web development.

So, going forward, you will be seeing a lot of Python and data science related posts in my blog. I am excited about this new adventure and I will keep you folks updated on my progress.

What about you? What did you do in July?

Do let me know in the comments.

That’s all for me. See you folks in August.

Adios until then.
