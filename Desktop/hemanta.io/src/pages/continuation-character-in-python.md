The readability of your program will suffer if you have code lines that are more than, letâ€™s say 80 characters long.

In such cases, you can use the continuation character (the **_backslash_** character) at the end of a line and Python will act as though you are still on the same line.

**Example:**

```py {numberLines}
addition = 1 + \
           2 + \
           3

print(addition)
# 6
```
