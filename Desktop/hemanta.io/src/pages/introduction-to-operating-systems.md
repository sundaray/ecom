An operating system or OS is system software that’s responsible for handling the basic functionalities of a computer. Some examples of popular OSs are:

- Windows
- Linux
- Mac
- Android
- iOS

Every computer contains at least one operating system which starts working the moment a computer is turned on. The OS has control over both the hardware and software resources of a computer. At the core of an operating system is the _kernel_ which manages the interaction between the hardware and software components of a computer.

### Functions of an OS

Some of the vital functions of an OS are as follows:

- Process management
- Memory management
- File management
- IO management
- Multitasking
- Networking
- Security
- Providing a user interface

### Process Management

Our computers run a lot of software. Word processing documents, internet browsers, a spreadsheet document, video games - all of these are examples of software.

**When we run a program, the instance of that execution is represented by a process**. Operating systems handle the responsibility of managing active processes.

### Memory Management

We use a significant amount of memory in order to store data in our computers; however, all data is not treated the same. Some data like pictures need to be stored permanently. Other data like the information we need to run a process, only needs to be stored temporarily while the application is in use. This temporary memory is known as the **primary or main memory**. While hardware like hard disks are used to store permanent data , **the operating system is responsible for the management of the primary memory stored in RAM**.

### File System Management

If we store our source code, for example a C program, in a folder in our computer, we are utilising our computer’s file system. The operating system manages information about individual files as well as the directories they belong in. The OS is also responsible for maintaining file systems by being able to perform tasks such as creating, deleting, renaming and copying files and/or directories.

### IO Management

IO stands for Input/Output and represents the devices used for interaction. A mouse is considered an input device, because we use them to send data to our computer. A monitor is regarded as an output device since it is used to communicate data (like an image) to us, the user. The operating system plays a larger role in managing IO by ensuring communication between IO hardware and IO software.
