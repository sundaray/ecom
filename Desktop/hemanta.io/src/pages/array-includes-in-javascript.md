The ~~includes()~~ method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning ~~true~~ or ~~false~~ as appropriate.

```js {numberLines}
const fruits = ["Apple", "Strawberry", "Banana"]

console.log(fruits.includes("Apple"))
// true

console.log(fruits.includes("Grapes"))
// false
```
