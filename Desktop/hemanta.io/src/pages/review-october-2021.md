I had set 3 goals for myself for the month of October: revisit the React course by Jad Joubran, make progress through the _Learn JavaScript_ course by Jad Joubran and write a minimum of 30 blog posts.

I did revisit the React course and wrote 23 blog posts in total. But I did not touch _Learn JavaScript_ at all.

Most of my time was spent practicing React - I built two full-stack applications. It's writing the global state management logic using Redux Toolkit that usually takes a lot of time. Thankfully, I have some blog posts on the topic that act as excellent reference material.

Also, I figured out how to implement Google sign in using the OAuth 2.0 API in an Express + React application. I remember trying to implement the same months ago but I had given up halfway through because I could not figure out how to manage the login state of the user. This time, however, I did manage to find a solution.

I could have done more, but I was going through a job interview process, which was a big timesuck.

What’s the plan for November?

In November, I plan to solely focus on learning Next.js. I suspect that finding quality learning resources on Next.js is going to be a challenge, but I should be able to figure something out. With regard to blogging, my target is to write a minimum of 20 posts.

That’s all for me. What are your plans for November? Do let me know in the comments.

Adios, until then.
