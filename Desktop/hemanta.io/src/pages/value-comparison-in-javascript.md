For comparing values, JavaScript provides three operations:

- **Object.is(a, b)**
- **Strict equality comparison (===)** &
- **Loose equality comparison (==)**

### Object.is(a, b)

~~Object.is(a, b)~~ tells us if ~~a~~ & ~~b~~ are the same value:

```js {numberLines}
console.log(Object.is(2, 2)) // true

console.log(Object.is({}, {})) // false
```

> ~~Object.is()~~ is not specific to objects. It can compare any two values.

> ~~{}~~ always means **create a new object value**.

### Strict equality (===)

Triple equals comparison (~~===~~) has the same behavior as ~~Object.is()~~ except the following two special cases:

#### First special case

> ~~Nan === NaN~~ is ~~false~~, although they are the same value.

The reason ~~NaN === NaN~~ being ~~false~~ is largely historical.

#### Second special case

> ~~-0 === 0~~ & ~~0 === -0~~ are ~~true~~, although they are different values.

Floating point zero is either positively or negatively signed. This is useful in representing certain mathematical solutions, but as most situations donâ€™t care about the difference between ~~-0~~ & ~~+0~~, strict equality treats them as the same value.

### Loose equality (==)

Loose equality compares two values for equality after converting both values to a common type. After conversion, (_one or both sides may undergo conversions_), the final equality comparison is performed exactly as ~~===~~ performs it.

However, in most cases, using loose equality is discouraged. The result of a comparison using strict equality is easier to predict and may evaluate more quickly due to lack of type coercion.
