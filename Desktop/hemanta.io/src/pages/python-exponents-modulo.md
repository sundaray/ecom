### Exponents

In Python, we use the notation ~~\*\*~~ to perform exponentiation.

```py {numberLines}
# 2 squared
print(2 ** 2)
# 4

# 8 cubed
print(8 ** 3)
# 512
```

### Modulo

The modulo operator is indicated by ~~%~~ and gives the remainder of a division calculation. If the number is divisible, then the result of the modulo operator will be 0.

```py {numberLines}
print(12 % 2)
# 0

print(8 % 3)
# 2
```
