A database stores structured information(data). The data is typically stored electronically in a computer system.

The most common types of databases (_known as relational databases_) organize and store data as a set of tables with rows & columns, similar to tables in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.

A database is usually controlled by a database management system(DBMS), which allows end users (or programs) to retrieve, update and manage how the information is organized and optimized. MySQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL server, Orcale Database etc. are some of the examples of database softwares.

Together the data and the DBMS, along with the applications they are associated with are referred to as database systems or just database.
