An expression is **any valid JavaScript code that resolves to a value**.

This means, it's any JavaScript code that has an end result, for example:

- ~~1 + 2~~
- ~~typeof(4)~~
- ~~new Date()~~
- ~~2 \* 4~~

And the list goes on...

Every one of these expressions, resolves to a value, for example:

- ~~1 + 2~~ resolve to the number ~~3~~
- ~~typeof(4)~~ resolves to the primitive data type ~~number~~
- ~~new Date()~~ resolves to a date object
- ~~2 \* 4~~ resolves to the number ~~8~~
