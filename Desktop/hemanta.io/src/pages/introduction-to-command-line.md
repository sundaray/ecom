The command line is a text interface for the computerâ€™s operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.

> On Mac & Linux systems, we access the command line through something called _Bash_.

The following are some of the commonly used commands in Unix based systems such as Linux & Mac OS X to navigate through the file system:
