DEEP is an acronym that helps outline what a good product backlog consists of.

- **D**: Detailed appropriately

This means that the stories at the top of the backlog are more detailed and stories at the bottom of the backlog are less detailed.

- **E**: Estimated

This means that only the prioritized stories at the top of the backlog are estimated.

- **E**: Emergent

This means that stories are modified, updated and removed as needed.

- **P**: Prioritized

This means that the stories are prioritized according to value and importance.

Once the product owner has prioritized the user stories in the product backlog, they are marked as “ready” for discussion and implementation. The discussion happens during the planning meeting.
