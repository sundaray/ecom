It’s the end of the month, which means it’s time to take stock of my learning progression. I had set modest targets for the month of September. I wanted to finish a course on VBA programming and write a minimum of 30 blog posts. And I achieved both of my targets. I finished the course **Excel VBA Programming - The Complete Guide** by Boris Paskhaver and wrote 60 blog posts. I now have a thorough understanding of VBA fundamentals and can write complex scripts with much more ease and confidence. In addition, I also learnt and wrote about different sorting algorithms using JavaScript. So, all in all, I am happy with the progress I made in September.

Every month I end up buying one or two courses. Yesterday, I bought a course on CSS by Josh W Comeau. The hype around the course had reached its peak on Twitter and I could not resist. Even though I have a solid understanding of CSS, I am sure I am going to learn a ton. I can’t wait to get started. I also bought the book **Decoding the Technical Interview Process** by Emma Bostian. I had high hopes but the book turned out to be a dud. Don’t buy it.

So, what’s the plan for October?

In October, I will revisit the React course by Jad Joubran. I have already finished the course, but I want to go through it again because I have not practiced React for a while now and I don’t want my React skills to go rusty anytime soon. I will also simultaneously make progress through the **Learn JavaScript** course by Jad Joubran. Besides, I will write a minimum of 30 blog posts.

That’s all from me.

What about you? What did you learn in September and what’s your plan for the coming months? Do let me know in the comments.

See you folks at the end of October. Adios until then.
