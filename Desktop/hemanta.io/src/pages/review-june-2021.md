###### Read my May’21 review [here](https://hemanta.io/review-may-2021/).

For June, I had set two goals for myself: (1) complete the ~~GraphQL with React: The Complete Developers Guide~~ course that I had bought in Udemy and (2) complete the initial draft of a blog series on how to create a developer blog with Gatsby and markdown.

And, I did not complete any of them. Well, I completed the first part of the course - building a GraphQL API. I even wrote a 8-part [blog series](https://hemanta.io/how-to-build-an-express-graphql-server-part-one/) on how to build a GraphQL-Express server explaining the concepts that I learnt in the course.

I did not complete the rest of the course because I wanted to learn how to build a GraphQL API using Apollo Server, because most of the GraphQL resources that I came across used Apollo Client & Apollo Server.

Then I came across Apollo’s official learning platform called [Odyssey](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/). There, I completed two parts: Lift off-part 1 & Lift off part 2.

Now, I have a better understanding of GraphQL.

What happened to the Gatsby blog series?

Well, I did not start because of time constraints. However, I managed to write 38 blog posts, (_mostly related to JavaScript & React_), which is more than 1 blog post per day.

What else did I do in June?

I bought and assigned a custom domain - www.hemanta.io - to this blog hosted on Netlify.

I also completed 19 chapters of a React course that I had bought a long time ago and had forgotten about. The course is by Jad Jourban (a Google Developer Expert) and it is excellent so far.

So, June was a productive month overall.

What’s the plan for July?

My target is to complete another 20 chapters from the React course and write another 10 posts for my blog. It’s not an ambitious target as I see myself getting busy with some work-related projects.

That’s all from me. What did you do in June and what are your plans for the coming months? Let me know in the comments.

Catch you all soon...
