### Product Owner

A **Product Owner**, often referred to as PO in short, is seen as the Product Champion and represents the voice of the customer. They are responsible for working with both the Agile Team as well as the business to maximize the value of the product deliverables being worked on. The Product Owner is primarily responsible for prioritizing and managing the **Product Backlog**, or the prioritized work item list.

### Facilitator

A facilitator is the person who ensures that the Agile Team moves along at an acceptable pace towards the business objectives and removes any blockages and impediments that may be slowing down the team.

> **The facilitator is usually an agile coach who promotes Agile practices and values.**

### The Agile Team

The Agile team members are the ones who accomplish the actual work of completing and delivering a potentially shippable version of the product at the end of each iteration. They are responsible for determining how to get the work done that the PO has prioritized.
